# RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation with Python

This project performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their transaction history. The goal is to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer retention, and maximize customer lifetime value.

## Key Analyses

-   **RFM Value Calculation:** Determines the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for each customer.
-   **RFM Scoring:** Assigns scores from 1-5 for each RFM metric.
-   **Customer Segmentation:** Groups customers into meaningful segments like 'Champions', 'Potential Loyalists', and 'At-Risk Customers'.
-   **Segment Visualization:** Uses bar charts and treemaps to analyze the distribution and value of each customer segment.

## Technologies Used

-   Python
-   Pandas & NumPy
-   Plotly
-   Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas`, `plotly`, `notebook`).
3.  Open `rfm_customer_segmentation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells.
